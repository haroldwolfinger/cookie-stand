# cookie-stand
This repo contains work for lecture-06 and lecture-07 

## lecture-06
The main.js file includes FOR LOOPs to calculate avgSales and daily cookies sold for each store location; however, content is not being pushed correctly to the sales.html file. Daily cookies sold are tallied correctly in the concatenated string within the console.log statements; they are listed first by each location, and then as the total aggregate sold.

### CodePartners Assignment Overview: Lab 6
<[Here's the link to the repo with more detailed instructions](https://github.com/CodePartnersMD/MD201-01/tree/master/lecture-06/lab "Assignment Overview: Lab 6")

*Before writing a single line of code, be sure that you have a new repository (with a README!) called cookie-stand, and do your work in that directory. Each day you'll be working in separate branches. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Branch names can be whatever you want; it is suggested that you use some sort of standard organization such as `day-feature` for the branch name, such as `tue-models`.*

Include in your repository a `.eslintrc.json` file whose contents are copied from the `eslintrc.json` file in the class repository.

### User Stories (MVP)
 - As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my  Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
 - As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
 - As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand

### Technical Requirements
 - New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
 - Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history
 - Good use of Object Literals **(no constructors allowed today)**; one for each store model(at least 3); properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
 - Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
 - Stores are correctly rendering as lists to the main page

### User Stories (Stretch... only after completing everything above)
 - As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business
